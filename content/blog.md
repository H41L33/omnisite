## Posts & Updates

A link directory to all my posts, available to view as page, download as plaintext or markdown. Each post is a copy of boilerplate HTML like the rest of this website, and has been written directly into HTML.

I have my own scripts to convert my content between HTML, Markdown, and TXT (now powered by [Slate](https://github.com/H41L33/slate) ✨).

All the content is loaded immediately, no infinite scrolling, and all my posts are available to view as a page, or download in TXT and MD formats.

[!NOTE] Posts are listed below with direct links to view, download as `.md`, or download as `.txt`. They're all the same content, just different formats for your convenience.

## Posts - Newest First

[!TIP] Check back regularly for new content. I write about software development, web3, tech experiments, and whatever else I'm working on at the time.
