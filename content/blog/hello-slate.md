# Hello, Slate

This is my first blog post using Slate v0.2.7! 🎉.

v0.2.7 is a massive update to Slate, that takes it from a simple transpiler to a full static site generator.

Slate can now create new sites, pages, and posts, all using relative links and metadata to keep track of where everything is; allowing some pretty cool features like IPFS!
