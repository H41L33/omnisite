## Hello!

Welcome to my website, here you can find (almost) everything there is to know about me, Hailey Welsh.

On this website I have:

- A Blog
- A Showcase
- Contact Details
- Miscellaneous Media
- Links to my Other Profiles, GitHub, and LinkedIn

For future reference, this website can be accessed through the following methods:

| Type    | URL                                                                         |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| WWW     | [!EXTERNAL] [about.haileywelsh.me](https://about.haileywelsh.me/index.html) |
| Offline | [!EXTERNAL] [Github Omnisite Repo](https://github.com/H41L33/omnisite)      |

[!TIP] An "omnisite" is the term I've coined for the output of my custom static-site-generator, `slate`. I've named them "omnisites" because they are built to function across multiple protocols, not just the World-Wide-Web, therefore called them a "website" is a bit reductionist. You can find the Markdown sources for all the pages on the "omnisite" repo.

[!NOTE] I've got Tor, Gemini & Gopher support coming soon! My static-site-generator currently builds for all three of these (obviously Tor), all I need to do is get them hosted.

Why do I have so many? Plain and simple: I find them all interesting (perhaps not the offline, that's pretty boring), and also the newer stuff (Gemini and ENS) is just plain cool. But for real, accessibility, privacy, and the right to choose are all important to me. It's my own conscious undertaking to create an online presence for myself, and part of that (in my eyes) is ensuring all users can access it, regardless of their own tooling.

That's also why this site is functionally static, i.e. JavaScript is only used for decorative elements that do not contribute to the deliverance of any information. If you're using a browser that has disabled JavaScript, this website will still work, and still look fabulous (which, let's be honest, it does!).

This also means you can access this website using a TUI browser, such as `lynx`, if you wanted to.

All the content is loaded immediately, no infinite scrolling, and all my posts are available to view as a page, or download in TXT and MD formats.

[!NOTE] A post in TXT format is quite literally the exact same as MD, you'll just be download a `.txt` instead of a `.md`.

With all that said, why don't you take a look at my [showcase](/pages/showcase.html) 😘.
